## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Utility classes
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Experience doing more custom styling using custom properties. Studied style scoping when dealing with custom properties. New styling properties and user-action pseudo classes such as `:hover` and `:focus`.Additionality, I took the opportunity to learn how to use local fonts (@font-face). More flexbox, responsive styling and many more learnings!

### Continued development

My goal is to experiment with different use cases of custom properties and reusability. Getting comfortable naming classes. Learn more responsive best practices.

### Useful resources

- [Design system](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/univershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&t=17455s) - Kevin is such as great CSS guy. I learn a lot when dealing with design systems from mockups to actual usage in code.

For example:

```CSS
:root {
  /* colors */
  --clr-yellow: 47 88% 63%;
  --clr-dark-gray: 0 0% 7%;
  /* ... */
  /* NOTE: putting these property declarations help reusability and ensure consistency whatever style guide it bases off */
}
```

- [HTML/CSS concepts - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I use this resource in looking up for `@font-face`, pseudo classes, and more.
